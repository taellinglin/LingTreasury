A radiant Chinese princess, front and center, her face fully in frame and expressing gentle, kawaii charm. She retains her traditional Chinese appearance but infused with subtle surreal DMT fractals in delicate patterns along her robes and hair. Her hair flows softly in iridescent hues of jade, crimson, and sapphire. She wears ornate Tang dynasty-inspired robes embroidered with celestial motifs, lotus mandalas, and soft shimmering accents. Her large, sparkling eyes reflect gentle starlight and whimsical visions, emphasizing a cute, endearing expression. The background is a smooth, solid pastel gradient, highlighting her figure without distraction. The scene is painted in the warm, whimsical Studio Ghibli style, with ethereal lighting, fine textures, and a balance of magical charm and psychedelic wonder â€” serene, beautiful, kawaii, in the style of ROYGBIV DMT Studio Ghibli.
